Backbone Boilerplate
====================

This boilerplate is a solid starting point for building a new Backbone application with the [Aerobatic HTML5 cloud platform](http://www.aerobatic.io). It is forked from the [Backbone Boilerplate](https://github.com/backbone-boilerplate/backbone-boilerplate) repo developed by @tbranyen with contributions from several prominent members of the Backbone community. It uses requirejs for dependency management and comes ready with unit testing all setup.

## Getting started ##
Make sure you have the yoke-cli tool installed: `npm install -g yoke-cli`

Create your own Aerobatic app based on this template by running the following:

yoke create-app --github-repo 'aerobatic/backbone-boilerplate' --github-branch 'grunt-yoke'
```
